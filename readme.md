## Don't forget to give a :star: to make the project popular.

## What is it all about?

I have been using Rest-Assured framework all the time for testing APIs with Java. But this time it was my project's demand to perform API testing in Javascript.
Being a newbie to JS, I googled for some tools and found `SuperTest`.
To introduce `SuperTest`, it is a high level abstraction of HTTP requests, making it perfect for testing APIs.
I decided to do a POC of this tool to understand it better, hence this project was created.
I thought of sharing this on github, so it helps others as well who want to learn more about this tool.

## Getting Started:

You need to have the following installed in your machine:

1. Node (Latest Version).
2. npm(Latest Version).
3. I have used `mocha` framework for writing tests and `chai` for assertions, following command should help to install the required npm packages:
   `npm i -D supertest mocha chai`
4. For running the tests, you need to type the command: `npm test`. _(Check Package.json for more details)_
5. For generating the mochawesome report, run the command `npm run report` _(Check Package.json for more details.)_ It will generate and export the report in `mochawesome-report` folder from which you can open the `index.html` file to view the report.

## Talking more about the Scenarios Covered in this project:

- I have covered, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests. You will find the example code in the test folder of the repository.

- End to End scenarios have been added for the restful booker APIs. If you need to get into more details about [how to write tests using supertest,mocha and chai?][mediumblog], this blog is all you need to refer and get started.

- Mochawesome reporter is used to generate the reports and show summary of the tests. I found it quite useful report as it shows the test description alongwith the tests and the time taken to run the tests.
